Simply put, a service is a "background process" that is started or stopped based on certain circumstances.
You are not required to manually start and/or stop it.
A 'systemd service file' is a file that is written in a format such that systemd is able to parse and understand it, and later on do what you told it to do.
'systemd service file'=='systemd unit'.
