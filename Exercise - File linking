cd ~

Q: Create a file called test1.
A: touch test1

Q: Create a hard link to test2 to the file you've just created.
A: ln test1 test2

Q: Verify that the two files are sharing the same inode.
A: ls -i test1 test2

Q: Change test1 content by echo "hi" >> test1
A: echo "hi" >> test1

Q: How does test2 look like?
A: cat test2 -> the same as test1 as it points to the same location in the memory

Q: What happens when you copy test2 to another directory? What happens when you move test2 to another directory?
A: mkdir temp
   cp test2 temp/
   cat temp/test2 -> "hi"
   
   upon copy -> both copies point to the correct place and contain the text "hi"
   
   rm temp/test2
   mv test2 temp/
   cat temp/test2 -> "hi"
   
   upon move -> nothing happens. test2 under temp still contains the text "hi"
   
Q: Create a symlink for test1.
A: ln -s test1 test3

Q: Remove test1, what happened to the symlink you've just created?
A: rm test1

   test3 is now a broken link as the file it pointed to is no longer available on the path, and the pointer on the file descriptor that pointed to it points to null.
